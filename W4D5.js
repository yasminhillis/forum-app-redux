/*
1-Write a function called getPeopleBornIn that takes an array and string month,
and returns a new array of people and their birthday information who were all born in the given month.

A sample input array would look like:

  {name: {first: "Alyssa", last: "Hacker"}, birthDay: {month: "June", day: 5, year: 1987}},
  {name: {first: "Ben", last: "Bitdiddle"}, birthDay: {month: "August", day: 19, year: 1984}},

  {name: {first: "Lem", last: "Tweakit"}, birthDay: {month: "August", day: 11, year: 1989}},
  {name: {first: "Louis", last: "Reasoner"}, birthDay: {month: "November", day: 17, year: 1992}}
];
A call to your function getPeopleBornIn(staff, 'August');
